# RLB (Rancho La Brea) project
This project represents an ongoing 10+ year collaboration between Dr. Donald Prothero and his assorted students (undergrad, grad, and ex-), including Dr. Val Syverson (@vjpsyverson), who hosts this repository. (If you're one of the coauthors and you want to be listed here, please contact me!)
The main themes of the project have been (1) body size change in vertebrate populations at RLB during the last glacial-interglacial cycle and (2) comparisons of the ontogenetic trajectories of extinct mammals to those of their living relatives. The bibliography below and the file structure of this repository both reflect this. However, several of the papers have addressed other subjects as well.
The files in this repository contain most of the data and R analysis routines used in this project, or at least all the parts of it in which @vjpsyverson has been involved. If you want to reanalyze the data or pick out specimens from the Page collections based on their measurements, the data should allow you to do that; if you want to borrow my R analysis code to save yourself a few steps in figuring out how to parse the data, you may also do that. If you're using any of it in a published project, though, please do contact either Val or Don and let us know what's up.
